# OctopathBossRandomizer
Boss Randomizer for Octopath Traveler (Steam)

### About
Tired of fighting the bosses in the same order over and over? Wondered what it would be like to fight Galdera instead of the Orge Eagle? 
Than this is the option for you. The Boss randomizer changes the story boss encounters with a few configurable options. 

### Requirements
Requires [Visual Studio Redistributable 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

### Usage
Head over to the releases section and download the latest version of the randomizer. Extract its contents somewhere, and run the executable inside.  
Find the pak dir of your Octopath Traveler installation using the browse button, usually located under
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\OCTOPATH TRAVELER\Octopath_Traveler\Content\Paks
```
Pick the options you want, and click randomize. The program will randomize the bosses, and place a patch pak file and a spoiler log in a subdir
named "BossRandomizer" in the pak dir.
